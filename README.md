spotify-hero
===============

This is a proof of concept of using spotify to learn playing the guitar, it is not fully functional and it is alpha and only for
come as you are, a song from nirvana.

## Running the application
To run the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called spotify-hero. 

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in `spotify:app:spotify-hero` in the search field.
Read more about this in the [Spotify Developer Guidelines](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/).
